######Using a string pattern in SQL to find observations which we're not specifically sure of###### 
  To that we use the "Like" predicate with string patterns to the search (like the wildcard operator in SAS or "in" with R)
  For better row filtering, you can also use the "between" statement to get a range
  
  Examples:
#Retrieve all employees who were born during the 1970's.
  SELECT F_NAME , L_NAME
  FROM EMPLOYEES
  WHERE B_DATE LIKE '197%';
  
#Retrieve all employees in department 5 whose salary is between 60000 and 70000.
  SELECT *
  FROM EMPLOYEES
  WHERE (SALARY BETWEEN 60000 AND 70000) AND DEP_ID = 5;  
  
  
  
#What i'm noticing is that a lot of SQL parameters are very similar to one we leared in SAS



######Sorting rows with SQL###### 
  We use the order by clause with the select statement (by defaulted is sorted in ascending order)
  
  Examples:
#Retrieve a list of employees ordered in descending order by department ID and within each department ordered alphabetically in descending order by last name.
  SELECT F_NAME, L_NAME, DEP_ID 
  FROM EMPLOYEES
  ORDER BY DEP_ID DESC, L_NAME DESC;
  
  
######Grouping result sets########
  first we could to eliminate duplicates with the distinct keywords 
  Better yet we could group by our specific variable to simplify the dataset
  We can change the column name with the "as" keyword to clarify meaning of the new column
  Then instead of using the "where clause" that works on the entire dataset, once we've grouped data we have to use the "having clause" to filter with the group by clause
  
  Examples:
#For each department retrieve the number of employees in the department, and the average employee salary in the department. +L abel the computed columns in the result set of SQL problem 2 (Exercise 3 Problem 2) as NUM_EMPLOYEES and AVG_SALARY.
  SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*) AS "NUM_EMPLOYEES", AVG(SALARY) AS "AVG_SALARY"
  FROM EMPLOYEES
  GROUP BY DEP_ID;
  
#For the above problem, limit the result to departments with fewer than 4 employees.
  SELECT DEP_ID, COUNT(*) AS "NUM_EMPLOYEES", AVG(SALARY) AS "AVG_SALARY"
  FROM EMPLOYEES
  GROUP BY DEP_ID
  HAVING count(*) < 4
  ORDER BY AVG_SALARY;
  
  
###### Built in database functions ######


Databse functions cane significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be retrieved - speed up data processing 

#Aggregate functions - takes the entire collections of values in a column and returns a single output

  Examples (Sum Min, Max, Mean, SD):
#Enter a function that displays the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table in a column called SUM_OF_COST.
  select SUM(COST) AS SUM_OF_COST from PETRESCUE;

#Enter a function that displays the average cost of rescuing a dog.
  select AVG(COST/QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL = 'Dog';


#Scalar and String functions - perform operations on every input value 

  Examples(Round, Length, Ucase, Lcase):
#Enter a function that displays the length of each animal name.
  select LENGTH(ANIMAL) from PETRESCUE;

#Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase without duplications.
  select DISTINCT(UCASE(ANIMAL)) from PETRESCUE;
  
#Enter a query that displays all the columns from the PETRESCUE table, where the animal(s) rescued are cats. Use cat in lower case in the query.
  select * from PETRESCUE where LCASE(ANIMAL) = 'cat';


###### Date and Time functions ######

  Examples:
#Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 5th month.
  select SUM(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where MONTH(RESCUEDATE)='05';

#Date or Time arithmetic 

  Example:
#Animals rescued should see the vet within three days of arrivals. Enter a function that displays the third day from each rescue.
  select (RESCUEDATE + 3 DAYS) from PETRESCUE;

#Enter a function that displays the length of time the animals have been rescued; the difference between todayâ€™s date and the recue date.
  select (CURRENT DATE - RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE;


###### Sub-queries and nested selects ######

Sub-query: a query inside another query. 
  Use sub-queries because aggregate functions like AVG() cannot be evaluated in the where clause, therefore use a sub-select expression 
    Typical example is as follows:

SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
WHERE column_name OPERATOR
   (SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
   FROM table1 [, table2 ]
   WHERE condition);
   
  Examples:
#Execute a working query using a sub-select to retrieve all employees records whose salary is lower than the average salary.
  select EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, SALARY 
  from employees 
  where SALARY < (select AVG(SALARY) 
                  from employees);

#Execute a Column Expression that retrieves all employees records with EMP_ID, SALARY and maximum salary as MAX_SALARY in every row.
  select EMP_ID, SALARY, ( select MAX(SALARY) from employees ) AS MAX_SALARY 
  from employees;
  
#Execute a Table Expression for the EMPLOYEES table that excludes columns with sensitive employee data (i.e. does not include columns: SSN, B_DATE, SEX, ADDRESS, SALARY).
  select * from ( select EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, DEP_ID from employees) AS EMP4ALL;


#Subqueries in the from clause can be a powerful tool when working with multiple tables and performing joins 


###### Working with multiple tables
  Many ways to access multiple tables in the same query:
  
    Sub-queries - an outer query accesses the employees table while the Sub-query on the departments tables is used for filtering the results of the outer query
  
  Examples:
#Retrieve only the EMPLOYEES records that correspond to jobs in the JOBS table.
  select * from employees where JOB_ID IN (select JOB_IDENT from jobs);

#Retrieve JOB information and whose birth year is after 1976.
  select JOB_TITLE, MIN_SALARY,MAX_SALARY,JOB_IDENT from jobs where JOB_IDENT IN (select JOB_ID from employees where YEAR(B_DATE)>1976 );
    
#Retrieve JOB information for female employees whose birth year is after 1976.
   select JOB_TITLE, MIN_SALARY,MAX_SALARY,JOB_IDENT from jobs where JOB_IDENT IN (select JOB_ID from employees where YEAR(B_DATE)>1976 and SEX='F' );
    
    Implicit join - sepecify two tables in the from clause to perform an implicit join where every row in the firs table is joined with every row in the second table, Can also use aliases for table names when importing multiple tables

  Examples:
#Perform an implicit cartesian/cross join between EMPLOYEES and JOBS tables.
  select * from employees, jobs;
  
#Retrieve only the EMPLOYEES records that correspond to jobs in the JOBS table.
  select * from employees, jobs where employees.JOB_ID = jobs.JOB_IDENT;

#Redo the previous query, but specify the fully qualified column names with aliases in the SELECT clause.
  select E.EMP_ID,E.F_NAME,E.L_NAME, J.JOB_TITLE from employees E, jobs J where E.JOB_ID = J.JOB_IDENT;
    
    
    
    Join operators (inner join, and outer join)
