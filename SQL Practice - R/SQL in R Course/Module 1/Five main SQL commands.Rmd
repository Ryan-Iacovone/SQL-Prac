#Useful expressions that can be used with select statements (Count, Distinct, and Limit)
  
  Count() - retrieves the number of rows matching the query criteria
    #Example finding the total number of olympic medals earned by canda 
      Select COUNT(country) 
        from medals
        where country = "Canada"
        
      #Example Retrieve the number of rows having a release year older than 1950 from the “FilmLocations” table.
        SELECT Count(*) 
          FROM FilmLocations 
          WHERE ReleaseYear<1950;
      
  Distinct() - is used to remove duplicate values from a result set 
    #Example finding the unique countries that received a gold medal, AKA removing all duplicate countries 
      Select Distinct country 
        from medals
        where medalytype = "gold"
        
      #Example - Retrieve the name of all unique films released in the 21st century and onwards, along with their release years.
        SELECT DISTINCT Title, ReleaseYear 
          FROM FilmLocations 
          WHERE ReleaseYear>=2001;
        
  Limit is used for restricting the number of rows retrived from database 
    #Example limiting the number of rows to look at in the medal data set 
      select * 
      from medals LIMIT 10
      
    #Example - Retrieve the next 3 film names distinctly after first 5 films released in 2015.
      SELECT DISTINCT Title 
      FROM FilmLocations 
      WHERE ReleaseYear=2015 LIMIT 3 OFFSET 5;
        

#Adding rows into a table with the insert statement

    VALUES (value1, value2, ... ); #specifies data values to be added into the table 
       
  Example - Insert two new instructor records into the “Instructor” table. First record with id 5 for John Doe who lives in Sydney, AU. Second record with id 6 for Jane Doe who lives in Dhaka, BD. 
  
    INSERT INTO Instructor(ins_id, lastname, firstname, city, country)
    VALUES(5, 'Doe', 'John', 'Sydney', 'AU'), (6, 'Doe', 'Jane', 'Dhaka', 'BD');
#Update and delete statements 
    
  Update statement (DML statement) -  altering or modifying existing data in the statement    
    Syntax:

      SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
      WHERE condition;
      
    Example - Update the city and country for Sandip with id 4 to Dhaka and BD respectively.
    
      UPDATE Instructor 
      SET city='Dhaka', country='BD' 
      WHERE ins_id=4;
